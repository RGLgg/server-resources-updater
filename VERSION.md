In order to automatically update the whitelists/plugins easily without the need for making unnecessary changes to files to complete a push, a simple +1 to the number below will force updates to whitelists and plugins that are included in the release zip.

NOTE: This file does not need to be touched if you do other commits as the whitelists will get updated anyways on all commits and eventually merges to master. Only do a version bump if you do not have any other changes to make to the file to force whitelist/plugin updates.
