# Server Resources for RGL.gg

Hi! This github repository contains all of the **required** plugins, configs, maps, etc. for RGL league play. The configs were created from scratch, though they were inspired by the UGC, ETF2L, and CEVO configs. The autoupdater plugin was also created from scratch, but heavily inspired by Miggy's (RIP) [UGCUpdate](https://github.com/Miggthulu/UGCUpdate) and [IntegriTF2](https://github.com/Miggthulu/IntegriTF2) plugins.

In creating the configs, I tried my best to prevent extra and/or useless commands while also minimizing the ability for cheating, exploitation, and unfair play due to preexisting client and/or server settings.

The RGL updater plugin automatically updates itself and the rest of the files downloaded to your server as this repository gets updated. 

It also contains Quality of Life tweaks for TF2 servers, such as:

* Preventing servers from automatically changing level after a match

* Warning server owners about cutting off STV before changing the level

* Automatically restarting servers after all players have left

* An automatic "Casting Antitroll" mode (enabled with `rgl_cast 1`) that locks your server's slot count at 12/12, 14/14, or 18/18, depending on what config is executed

If you find that was missed something in the configs, or if something doesn't work the way it should, and if you have a suggestion, *please submit an issue on GitHub*.

If you have problems with the plugin, or if you have a suggestion, please submit an issue with details. 


# Installation
## Prerequisites
[![Sourcemod Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/SourceMod-v1.10-blue?labelColor=d9860a&color=5596cf)](http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable)

With the TF2 Comp Fixes plugin requiring SM 1.10 at minimum due to SM 1.9 now being phased out. The RGL Server Resources Updater will **only support SourceMod 1.10 and higher**. Please make sure you get the right version for your server's operating system! Any previous versions of SourceMod are **unsupported**. 

**Note**: This plugin breaks on the SourceMod dev branch, which is currently on 1.11. Use stable branch instead.

This guide [here](https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Upgrading_SourceMod) contains instructions on how to upgrade the files, but please consider doing a fresh install of all your current files to avoid any potential issues. 

After installation, typing `sm version` into the server console will confirm if the update was successful.

## Install Instructions

1. [Update SourceMod to at least 1.10](https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php?branch=stable). SourceMod 1.11 currently breaks this plugin, however.
2. Download the latest zip by clicking on this badge [![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/RGLgg/server-resources-updater/total)](https://github.com/RGLgg/server-resources-updater/releases/latest/download/server-resources-updater.zip).

3. Navigate to your server install folder in an (S)FTP client of your choice.
4. Place everything inside the zip into the root `/tf/` folder. Overwrite any and all files that you get prompted for.
5. Done!

If you're runnning into errors, completely remove all of the old RGL configs and retry.

If you're still having trouble, there's step by step instructions with pictures over in the [wiki](https://github.com/stephanieLGBT/rgl-server-resources/wiki/Installation-Tutorial)!

## Updating Instructions

The plugin updates itself, along with the RGL configs, after every exec and changelevel. You should never manually edit any config that isn't a gamemode specific custom.cfg, because it will get automatically overwritten. This is to prevent cheating and ensure each server is running the same settings.

You will have to add new maps to your server manually as RGL introduces them to each gamemode's map pool. This is to prevent lengthly download times with the updater plugin. Simply download the new map and place it in the `/tf/maps/` folder, through an (S)FTP client of your choice, and you're done.


# !!Please read this section if you're not going to read anything else!!

There are different configs and plugins for scrims and matches if you're playing 5cp and koth in 6s. Halftimes in 5cp and koth are handled by the tf2Halftime plugin, mirrored from [here](https://github.com/stephanieLGBT/tf2-halftime).

Every other gamemode and type has the same config for scrims and matches.

Here are the configs you need to exec for specific modes and map types:

### Reset Config

`(rcon) exec rgl_off`

This will reset your server to default settings, plus whatever you have set in server.cfg. It *will not* unload the STV bot (though it will stop recording). A more detailed explanation is below.


#### On the off config and STV bugginess

There is something seriously wrong with STV in TF2. For no apparent reason, when you start it up, it eats a player slot by incrementing the value of your server's `maxplayers` by 1. This isn't a problem, typically, because TF2 can technically handle 33 "players", aka 32 + STV. If you were to set +maxplayers to 33 and then add stv, things would get ugly, really quickly.

But that's not all. When the bot is unloaded, it, for no apparent reason, reads the value of `tv_maxplayers` and sets your server's visible player count to *that* number. Why? Who knows. `sv_visiblemaxplayers` has ZERO effect on this. For that reason, I decided to *not* unload the STV bot in the `rgl_off` config, as things would get broken quickly if players didn't set `tv_maxplayers` AND `sv_visiblemaxplayers` to the same value, which also has to be at or under the server's slot limit.

For this reason, and on the advice of some server network operators, I have decided to not shut down stv with rgl_off. If you need to disable the STV, please restart your server.

The bug report for this issue is [here](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues/2778).
